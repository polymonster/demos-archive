	m_font[0] = glGenLists(MAX_CHARS);					// Generate the list for the font

	// Now we actually need to create the font.  We use a windows function called:
	// CreateFont() that returns a handle to a font (HFONT).  Our CreateOpenGLFont()
	// function allows us to pass in a name and height.  For simplistic reasons, I left
	// other options out, but feel free to add them to your function (like bold, italic, width..)

	hFont = CreateFont(	height,							// Our desired HEIGHT of the font
						0,								// The WIDTH (If we leave this zero it will pick the best width depending on the height)
						0,								// The angle of escapement
						0,								// The angle of orientation
						FW_BOLD,						// The font's weight (We want it bold)
						FALSE,							// Italic - We don't want italic
						FALSE,							// Underline - We don't want it underlined
						FALSE,							// Strikeout - We don't want it strikethrough
						ANSI_CHARSET,					// This is the type of character set
						OUT_TT_PRECIS,					// The Output Precision
						CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,			// The Clipping Precision
						ANTIALIASED_QUALITY,			// The quality of the font - We want anitaliased fonts
						FF_DONTCARE|DEFAULT_PITCH,		// The family and pitch of the font.  We don't care.
						"Comic Sans MS");					// The font name (Like "Arial", "Courier", etc...)

	// Now that we have created a new font, we need to select that font into our global HDC.
	// We store the old font so we can select it back in when we are done to avoid memory leaks.
	m_oldFont = (HFONT)SelectObject(hdc, hFont);

	// This function does the magic.  It takes the current font selected in
	// the hdc and makes bitmaps out of each character.  These are called glyphs.
	// The first parameter is the HDC that holds the font to be used.
	// The second parameters is the ASCII value to start from, which is zero in our case.
	// The third parameters is the ASCII value to end on (255 is the last of the ASCII values so we minus 1 from MAX_CHARS)
	// The last parameter is the base pointer for the display lists being used.  This should be 1.

void CText::positionText( int x, int y )
{
	// If you are to use this font code for your applications,
	// you must be aware that you cannot position the font in 3D,
	// which means you can't rotate and scale it.  That will be covered in
	// the next font tutorial.  BUT, though that might be a drag, this code
	// is useful because when you display the text, it will always be on top
	// of everything else.  This is good if the camera is moving around, and you
	// don't want the text to move.  If the text was positioned in 3D you would have
	// to come up with a tricky way of making it always render in front of the camera.
	// To do this, we need to set the Raster Position.  That is the position that OpenGL
	// starts drawing at.  Since it's in floating point, it's not very intuitive, so what
	// we do is create a new view port, and then always draw the text at (0, 0, 0) in that
	// view port.  The weird part is that the Y is flipped, so (0, 0) is the bottom left corner.
	// Below we do some simple math to flip it back to normal.

	// Before we create a new view port, we need to save the current one we have.
	// This saves our transform (matrix) information and our current viewport information.
	// At the end of this function we POP it back.
	glPushAttrib( GL_TRANSFORM_BIT | GL_VIEWPORT_BIT );

	// Here we use a new projection and modelview matrix to work with.
	glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );						// Set our matrix to our projection matrix
	glPushMatrix();										// Push on a new matrix to work with
	glLoadIdentity();									// reset the matrix
	glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW );						// Set our matrix to our model view matrix
	glPushMatrix();										// Push on a new matrix to work with
	glLoadIdentity();									// Reset that matrix

	// Because the Y is flipped, we want 0 to be at the top, not bottom.
	// If we subtract the font height from the screen height, that should display the
	// font at the top of the screen (if they passed in 0 for Y), but then we subtract
	// the Y from that to get the desired position.  Since the font's drawing point is
	// at the base line of the font, we needed to subtract the font height to make sure
	// if they passed in (0, 0) it wouldn't be off screen.  If you view this in window mode,
	// the top of the window will cut off part of the font, but in full screen it works fine.
	// You just need to add about 25 to the Y to fix that for window mode.

	y = g_screenHeight - FONT_HEIGHT - y;				// Calculate the weird screen position

	// Now we create another view port (that is why we saved the old one above).
	// Since glViewPort takes the lower LEFT corner, we needed to change the Y
	// to make it more intuitive when using PositionText().  We minus 1 from the X and Y
	// because 0 is taken into account with the position.  The next 2 parameters are set
	// to 0 for the width and height so it will always draw in the middle of that position.
	// glRasterPos4f() takes (0, 0, 0) as the middle of the viewport, so if we give it a small
	// width/height it will draw at the X and Y given.  Sounds strange, to test this, try
	// using glRasterPos4f(0, 0, 0, 1) instead of PositionText() and you will see, everything
	// will be drawn from the middle.

	glViewport( x - 1, y - 1, 0, 0 );					// Create a new viewport to draw into

	// This is the most important function in here.  This actually positions the text.
	// The parameters are (x, y, z, w).  w should always be 1 , it's a clip coordinate.
	// don't worry about that though.  Because we set the projection and modelview matrix
	// back to the beginning (through LoadIdentity()), the view port is looking at (0, 0, 0).
	// This is the middle, so if we set the drawing position to the middle, it will draw at our
	// X and Y because the width/height of the viewport is 0, starting at X and Y.
	// You can actually call this function (or glRasterPos2f(0, 0)) instead of PositionText(),
	// but it is in floating point and doesn't work as nicely.  You will see why if you try.

	glRasterPos4f( 0, 0, 0, 1 );						// Set the drawing position

	// Now that we positioned the raster position, any text we draw afterwards will start
	// from that position.  Now we just have to put everything else back to normal.

	glPopMatrix();										// Pop the current modelview matrix off the stack
	glMatrixMode( GL_PROJECTION );						// Go back into projection mode
	glPopMatrix();										// Pop the projection matrix off the stack

	glPopAttrib();										// This restores our TRANSFORM and VIEWPORT attributes

{
	char		strText[256];							// This will hold our text to display

	// If you have never used a va_list, listen up.  Remember printf()?
	// or sprintf()?  Well, you can add unlimited arguments into the text like:
	// printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old!", strName, age);
	// Well, that is what va_list's do.  

	// First we need to check if there was even a string given
	if (strString == NULL)								// Check if a string was given
		return;											// Don't render anything then

	// First we need to parse the string for arguments given
	// To do this we pass in a va_list variable that is a pointer to the list of arguments.
	// Then we pass in the string that holds all of those arguments.
	va_start(argumentPtr, strString);					// Parse the arguments out of the string

	// Then we use a special version of sprintf() that takes a pointer to the argument list.
	// This then does the normal sprintf() functionality.
	vsprintf(strText, strString, argumentPtr);			// Now add the arguments into the full string

	va_end(argumentPtr);								// This resets and frees the pointer to the argument list.

	// Before we draw the text, we need to position it with our own function.
	positionText(x, y);									// Call our own function to position the text on screen

	// Now, before we set the list base, we need to save off the current one.
	glPushAttrib(GL_LIST_BIT);							// This saves the list base information

	// Then we want to set the list base to the font's list base, which should be 1 in our case.
	// That way when we call our display list it will start from the font's lists'.
	glListBase(m_font[0]);							// This sets the lists base

	// Now comes the actually rendering.  We pass in the length of the string,
	// then the data types (which are characters so its a UINT), then the actually char array.
	// This will then take the ASCII value of each character and associate it with a bitmap.
