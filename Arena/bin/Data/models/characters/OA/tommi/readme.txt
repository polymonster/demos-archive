COMMENTS:
A cross between Tankgirl, Nathan Cabreras Tommi X9 
comic character and my own imagination.

The model uses Paul Steeds hunter bup. I made my own 
animations, but only to realize there was no way to 
get them from lightwave and in to Q3. Instead of reanimating 
them in a program I´ve never used before, I cheated :)
I´l just have to rerelease the model with me own anims as 
soon as an Lw-exporter pops up.

INSTALLATION:
Put the .pk3 in your baseq3 dir

Don´t hesitate to send me a comment,
I aprechiate feedback.
